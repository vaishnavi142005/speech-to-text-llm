Project Title: Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

Project Description:

This project focuses on developing a Speech-to-Text system designed to support automated transcription services. The core objective is to convert spoken audio input into accurate, readable text using state-of-the-art speech recognition technologies. The system is tailored for applications such as meeting transcriptions, podcast subtitles, customer service records, and accessibility tools.

Key components of the project include:

Audio Input Handling: Processing of audio files in formats like WAV or MP3.

Speech Recognition: Leveraging models like Google Speech Recognition API, DeepSpeech, or Whisper for converting audio to text.

Noise Filtering & Preprocessing: Improving accuracy through noise reduction and audio normalization techniques.

Text Output and Storage: Displaying and storing transcribed text in formats suitable for analysis or documentation.
